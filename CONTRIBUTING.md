# Contributing to Clothora

Thanks for your interest! This file contains a short, developer-focused contribution guide so links from the README work when cloned.

Guidelines

- Open an issue to discuss larger changes before you start.
- Keep pull requests small and focused (one feature or fix per PR).
- Follow the project's code style (TypeScript + React patterns). Run `npm run lint` before submitting.
- If you add functionality, include a short usage example or test.

Workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`.
3. Make changes and run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to test locally.
4. Commit with clear messages and open a PR against `main` with a description of your changes.

Contact

If you have questions, open an issue or contact the repository owner: `rashidvisda@gmail.com`.
